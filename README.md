# ElasticStack-toolbox
Provide a set of configuration and tools to jump quickly in Elastic stack.
Deployment and configuration support provided by scripts and templatce of configuration files.
* OS:
  * VM
  * Docker
  * Cloud instance
* Application:
  * Full Elastic stack: Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, Filebeat
  * Additional tool like syslog-ng to centralize the log
  * Management tools for the stack (reindex, duplicate, mapping...)

## Elastic stack setup
Two deployment scenarios and each one is provided with VM and docker methods.
Set up the OS and install and configure the main components of the Elastic stack.
Each of them is provided with a bash script and set of configuration files ready to use or at least to adapt for a specific production environment.
* [Elasticsearch](elasticsearch)
  * [Single-node](elasticsearch/single-node)
  * [Hot-Warm](elasticsearch/hot_warm)
* [Logstash](logstash)
  * [Pre-configured files for input, filter and output](logstash/conf.d/)
* [Filebeat](filebeat)
* [Kibana](kibana)

You will find all details in this [README](ES_README.md) file.

## [Syslog-NG](syslog-ng)
Syslog-ng configuration file is provided according to the data folder structure used in the setup.
The idea is to centralize the logs coming from all sources via a centralized syslog server.

## [Scripts](scripts)
Some useful tools to manage ES.
To be more efficient during the ES operation *reindexer*, "cloner*,... tools are provided under bash script.
* scripts/

You will find all details in this [README](scripts/README.md) file.

## [csr](csr)
How to generate all CSR and the associated key in one shot? foolow this script ;-)

## ToDo list
* Install logstash-filter-translate in Logstash
* Json diffusion as template
* Import JSON in elasticsearch and kibana (to complie and complete from the Damien's site)
* Provide additional elasticsearch *template*
* Finalize the Cisco TMS/CMS CDR/CMR integration
* Provide the bash scripts to manage the files vs archives in syslog-ng (backup.sh/clean.sh)
* Add _curator_ to the docker env

## Thanks
Thanks in advance to comment, improve, fork, PR... :-D
