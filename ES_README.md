# Elastic stack
Pre-settings to configure the Elastic Stack (after its initial installation)

Provide set of configuration files for:
* Elasticsearch indexing
* Logstash data collect and treatment (collection, parsing, extracting, cleaning)
* Filebeat template to transfert your logs to logstash
* Kibana visualization, filter and dashboard

## Elastic stack setup
Two deployment scenarios and each one is provided with VM and docker methods:

1 - VM
* `os_init.sh` is to setup the OS
* `cd {app} && ./install.sh` in the application folder is to install the application

 2 - Docker
* `docker-compose.yml` deploy the Elastic stack with the stack configuration placed in the docker-compose file. Run 2 indexes.
* `docker-compose_single-node.yml` deploy one component of the stack
* `docker-compose_hot-warm.yml` deploy 3 * ES-master, 3 * ES-hot, 3 * ES-warm and one component of the stack

Set up the OS and install and configure the main components of the Elastic stack.
Each of them is provided with a bash script and set of configuration files ready to use or at least to adapt for a specific production environment.
* [Elasticsearch](elasticsearch)
  * [Single-node](elasticsearch/single-node)
  * [Hot-Warm](elasticsearch/hot_warm)
* [Logstash](logstash)
* [Filebeat](filebeat)
* [Kibana](kibana)

## Security
To ensure the security without the x-pack extra licence, SearchGuard is used and specific note file can be found on the following liink:
* https://github.com/guillain/notes/blob/master/ELK_SearchGuard.txt

Search Guard will increase the security and add AUTH and TLS methode.
At this moment only the montioring is not fully secured as HTTP  only is allowed on this module (re-only ^^).

## Design 
Target is to apply the best Practice for a _real usage_.

Repartition by instance (Virtual Machine/Docker)
0/ Source
* _Install:_ filebeat (one of the  agents of the Elastic stack), syslog-ng
* _Source:_ local files
* _Target:_ logstash
* _What:_ Dedicated VM where the data source is/come from

1/ Data collection
* _Install:_ logstash
* _Source:_ (file)beat, stream
* _Target:_ elasticsearch
* _What:_
  1/ Input: Collect all sources
  2/ Filter: Extract the data according to the prototype
  3/ Output: push it to elasticsearch

  cf [logstash filters](logstash/conf.d/)

2/ Index
* _Install:_ elasticsearch
* _Source:_ logstash
* _Target:_ client
* _What:_ Store and index the data and provide API features to consum data and to manage the cluster

3/ Display
* _Install:_ kibana
* _Source:_ elasticsearch
* _Target:_ human
* _What:_ Provide web interface for the ES API access and to perform analytics, alerting, dashboarding, monitoring and machine learning jobs

Specific study must be done on your targeted environment to establish the nodes repartition and them sizing according to the role that they will have.
Example if you need to provide high search performance it can be interesting to separate the node in charge of and increase its resources...
For that two examples are provided:
* [elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml](elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml): one ES node with all-in-one, simple & easy for demo
* [elasticsearch/example-hot_warm](elasticsearch/example-hot_warm): set of ES files with hot-warm design described as follow:
  - 3 * master nodes (8GB,2CPU,32GB)
  - 3 * hot data nodes (32GB,8CPU,500GB)
  - 3 * warm data nodes (32GB,8CPU,2TB)
  - 1 * machine learning node (8GB,2CPU,32GB)

## Versions
This package is an old update coming from the 2.4 versions and up-to-date to run on 6.4.2 cluster.
Some previous configuration has been kept and it's generally when a major change have been done (impacting the applications).

## Installation (fast method for instance)
The installation scripts have been written based on CentOS-7 64, compatible with current AWS AMI.
`yum` has been used to install the package via the Elastic RPM repository.
Thanks to adapt to your environment so if your settings doesn't match...

## Configuration
Preconfigured files have been provided to be used as-it-is for a all-in-one server.
The instance should follow this settings for the single-node design:
* elasticsearch with 4GB dedicated memory
* kibana with 8GB dedicated memory
* logstash with 2GB dedicated memory

And this settings for the hot-warm design:
* elasticsearch with 4GB dedicated memory
* kibana with 8GB dedicated memory
* logstash with 2GB dedicated memory

PS: the memory is configured in the *jvm.options* file.
PS: a factor 2 should be considered in total for the system+app

The configuration is done without the licensed features and so without the necessary security.
Up to you to activate the ES security according to your license. An example of securisation is done with SearchGuard.

### FileBeat
Provide log template to quickly integrate on your host where the data should come.
* syslog
* audit
* redis
* apache
* apache-other-vhost
* apache-error
* dpkg
* cucm-cdr
* cucm-cmr
* bot: based on JSON and dynamic index

#### Installation example on CentOS server to be collected with Filebeat
```bash
git clone https://github.com/guillain/ElasticSearch-toolbox
cp ElasticSearch-toolbox/conf/filebeat/* /etc/filebeat/
systemctl restart filebeat
```

## Cisco CDR/CMR
I've not integrated the mecanism to get the CDR/CMR from the CUCM, up to you to add your choice.
FYI on my side I use the same mechanism than for the log files.
In that case you can use the same design and tools to manage your log files and CDR/CMR files coming from your Unified Communication environment and also from your Visio Conferencing system.
PS it's time to open your S3 or Glacier to make it as permanent application backup...

### Cisco TMS CDR/CMR

### Cisco CUCM CDR/CMR
Thanks to [Damienetwork](https://damienetwork.wordpress.com) and its [website](https://damienetwork.wordpress.com/2015/10/09/elk-setup-for-cucm-cdr/).
At this time validated only for the Cisco CUCM (Call Manager) for these version:
* 6
* 8
* 10

## GeoIP
Thanks to:[manicas](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/users/manicas) and its [article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-map-user-location-with-geoip-and-elk-elasticsearch-logstash-and-kibana)

[GeoIP](http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz) is included in apache and syslog conf...
* To continue in other configuration
* Or can declared as generic field under 'clientip' name

## Kibana
Principle:
* Unarchive the package
* Copy the content in your logstash configuration folder
* Adapt the conf to your elasticseaerch server in the 3xx output 
* Download the GeoIP database
* Install the CUCM CDR/CDR features
